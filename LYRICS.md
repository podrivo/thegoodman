The Good Man, by Husky Rescue

I am the superman  
The great enemy of evil  
I fight for goodness  
Fight for what's right  
The superman  
With superpowers  
The super good  
Against bad behavior

I've always been a superman  
When I was a boy  
I wanted to be a fireman  
Run through the flames with my super helmet  
Pump up water and fight the fire  
Hot flames and evil smoke  
Smash things up with a big hammer  
And rescue all the good people  
The proper citizens

I wanted to make my mom proud of me  
She was my superwoman  
I wanted to be a doctor  
Fight against diseases with my knowledge  
Make my mom immortal  
Help everybody who was in trouble or feeling bad

I wanted to be an officer  
A policeman with a blue uniform  
Put bad people into jail and keep crime off the streets  
Chase gangsters with my super car  
And shoot them up with my bullets

I wanted to be a great man  
Like my father  
A good man  
Taking care of his loving family  
Wife and son  
Coming home everyday after work and  
Read a newspaper  
Build a house in the countryside  
I'd go fishing

Now I got it all  
Well, my wife doesn't love me anymore but
That's ok  
I've got the other plans already  
I have it all figured out  
I am the superman  
Fight against the bad

One day  
I'll fly away  
Like a butterfly  
High up into the sky  
And I'll touch the sun
